"""
Code to manage the cleanup of images with one or more tags.

The logic here is:
 - identify all images we should retain based on the "keep" argument
 - also identify all images that are in use
 - then, find all images that match our filters and aren't in the first two sets

Evaluation of "keep" is done on a global basis to avoid situations like this:
 - image A has repotags "foo:image1" and "bar:image1", and timestamp N
 - image B has repotag "foo:image2", and timestamp >N
 - the command is run with "--keep 1 --name foo"

... the situation is a bit ambiguous, but an approach that errs on the side of not deleting
things is best.

We *could* also skip the "identify images in use" check, just attempt to delete all of the images,
and rely on Docker blocking the deletion of images that are being used by containers. While that
would simplify the code and might improve runtime a hair, then the tool would generate error output
even when functioning as intended - not a good practice for a tool, as that makes it difficult to
detect real errors.
